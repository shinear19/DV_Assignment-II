# Data Science & Machine Learning Solutions

Welcome to this repository containing solutions to a variety of data science and machine learning challenges. Each task demonstrates key concepts and techniques, from *Kernel Density Estimation* to *web scraping* and *geospatial data visualization*. These solutions utilize popular Python libraries such as yfinance, Bokeh, seaborn, requests, and others. Below is a description of each task and the approach taken to solve it.

### 1. *Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)*
- *Objective: The goal of this task is to demonstrate **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)*, which is a method for estimating the probability density function of a continuous random variable.
- *Approach*: The solution involves performing KDE on a sample dataset, providing a smooth, continuous estimation of the data distribution, as opposed to the traditional histogram.
- *Libraries Used*: seaborn, matplotlib, numpy

---

### 2. *Bivariate Distribution with Apple Stocks Dataset*
- *Objective: This task analyzes Apple stock data to understand the relationship between two variables: **daily returns* and *trading volume*.
- *Approach*: Apple stock data is fetched using the yfinance library. The code computes daily returns from adjusted closing prices, then visualizes the relationship with trading volume using a bivariate *Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)* plot.
- *Libraries Used*: yfinance, seaborn, matplotlib

### 3. *Geospatial Data Visualization Using Bokeh*
- *Objective: In this task, we create an interactive **geospatial data* visualization using the *Bokeh* library.
- *Approach: The code generates a scatter plot displaying the locations of cities based on their latitude and longitude. With **Bokeh's interactive features*, the plot allows users to zoom, pan, and view additional information such as city names and coordinates upon hovering.
- *Libraries Used*: Bokeh, ColumnDataSource

---

### 4. *Network Visualization of Geospatial Data*
- *Objective: This task visualizes the interconnections between cities as a **network graph*.
- *Approach*: Using geospatial data (latitude and longitude), the cities are represented as nodes, and the connections between them are drawn as edges. The graph shows how the cities are connected, helping to visualize relationships and distances.
- *Libraries Used*: networkx, matplotlib

---

### 5. *Web Scraping and HTTP Programming*
- *Objective: The task demonstrates **web scraping* and *image downloading* over HTTP.
- *Approach*: The code fetches an HTML page via the requests library, parses the content with BeautifulSoup, and extracts the image URL. The image is then downloaded and saved locally.
- *Libraries Used*: requests, BeautifulSoup4

---

### 6. *Working with Web Services (XML)*
- *Objective: In this task, the focus is on working with **XML data* from a web service.
- *Approach*: The code sends a request to an API that returns XML data. Using xml.etree.ElementTree, the XML is parsed, and specific details (like titles and links) are extracted for further processing or display.
- *Libraries Used*: requests, xml.etree.ElementTree
